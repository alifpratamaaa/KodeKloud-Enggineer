Task:
The system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries has streamlined access management by implementing group-based access control. Here's what you need to do:

a. Create a group named nautilus_sftp_users across all App servers within the Stratos Datacenter.
b. Add the user stark into the nautilus_sftp_users group on all App servers. If the user doesn't exist, create it as well.

Answer:
thor@jumphost ~$ ssh tony@stapp01
The authenticity of host 'stapp01 (172.16.238.10)' can't be established.

This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
