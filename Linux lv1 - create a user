Task:
In response to heightened security concerns, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted for custom Apache users for their web applications. 
Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. Your task is to create a custom Apache user according to the outlined specifications:

a. Create a user named jim on App server 1 within the Stratos Datacenter.
b. Assign a unique UID 1384 and designate the home directory as /var/www/jim.

Answer:
thor@jumphost ~$ ssh tony@stapp01
tony@stapp01's password: 
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ 
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ clear
-bash: clear: command not found
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ pwd
/home/tony
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ clean
-bash: clean: command not found
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ clear
-bash: clear: command not found
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ useradd -u 1384 -d /var/www/jim jim
useradd: Permission denied.
useradd: cannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later.
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo useradd -u 1384 -d /var/www/jim jim

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for tony: 
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ id jim
uid=1384(jim) gid=1384(jim) groups=1384(jim)
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ grep jim /etc/passwd
jim:x:1384:1384::/var/www/jim:/bin/bash
[tony@stapp01 ~]$
